# Atto
Repository for the work I'll conduct with the AttoSecond group at King's College London.

The main objectives will be to generate a Neural Network to recognize Diffraction patterns generated by quantum path interference in electrons during High Harmonic Generation.

Thus far there is one file, which serves to represent the path taken by an electron after it tunnels out of the potential well, and is influenced by the electric field of the wave which originally
deformed the potential well.
